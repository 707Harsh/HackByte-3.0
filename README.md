# 🌾 AgriConnect — Break the Red Tape

AgriConnect is a role-based platform designed to revolutionize agricultural collaboration by eliminating outdated paperwork and automating contract workflows. Built for the "Break the Red Tape" hackathon, our solution focuses on farmers and contractors—two essential stakeholders who often face inefficiencies in managing contracts, farm data, and communication.

## 🚨 The Problem

In rural sectors, paperwork is still king—and that’s a problem. Manual processes lead to delays, confusion, and lost opportunities. We asked: what if there were a better way to connect farmers and contractors? One that understands documents, simplifies profiling, and automates decision-making?

## 💡 The Solution

AgriConnect introduces intelligent, role-based dashboards for both farmers and contractors. Users can access editable profiles, manage contracts, view analytics, and interact with an intuitive interface that simplifies data handling. Our app dynamically routes users based on their roles, offering tailored dashboards via secure protected layouts.
